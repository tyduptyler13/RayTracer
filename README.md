RayTracer
====
By: Tyler Scott

Version 2

Purpose
----
This version of the raytracer is designed to be used as a realtime rendering library.
If you are looking for stand-alone rendering then it is recommended to see the version 1
branch. It is designed to be used as a commandline custom raytracer.

This library is still being developed.

Status
----
* Currently working on moving all of the packages and increasing the abilities of the math
libraries.
* Next is to improve the scene graph setup to allow for the renderer to be replaced with
an opengl, opencl, cpu, etc... backend. This will allow for the most capability.
* Final steps are to fix any issues in the new setup and improve performance.
* Future: Increase capabilities and allow for dynamic performance.
